goal:
	Create a calculator with an interactive GUI. The idea is that each
	button on the calculator is pressed, and the corresponding value is
	added onto the calculator's "screen". If the contents of the screen
	is valid (a valid mathematical expression), pressing calculate will
	output the value of the expression.

	There will be 7 different operators:
	+, -, *, /, %, ^, sqrt

	A valid expression involves matching parenthesis, correct use of 
	operators (a +-*/%^ b or sqrt(a))

	PEMDAS needs to be followed.

	project structure:
		- one driver/main class
		- one display class
		- one button class
		- one output window class

	validity only needs to be checked once calculation is requested, not
	dynamically.

	clearing input and deleting one char at a time should be supported.
